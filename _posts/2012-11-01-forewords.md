So this is my first post on that blog, this is quite an exciting moment, I just finished playing around with my first dedicated server, configuring some DNS stuff and installing WordPress (as far as I can tell, great blog engine by the way).

Anyhow, my name is Hadrien, I am a french developer working at Atos Worldline GIS department.

What about this blog? Well, as a developer I often struck my head on problems and I thought I would humbly share my fears and solutions on the web. I will talk about GIS but also about Flex/Flash, Maven, Java and fashionable stuff such as WebGL, HTML5, Ruby on Rails and whatever I find worthy talking about.

You can find me to several places such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/htulipe "Twitter profile"), [LinkedIn](http://lnkd.in/6Bsqft "LinkedIn profile"), [Github](http://github.com/htulipe "Github profile") or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/htulipe "Bitbucket profile").
